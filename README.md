# Hi there, I'm Aishwarya 👋

🎓 MS in Artificial Intelligence @ University at Buffalo  
💼 Former SDE II @ AppViewX | ML Intern @ New Era Cap  
🚀 Exploring the intersection of AI Agents, ML Infrastructure, and Applied NLP  

---

👩‍💻 I’m passionate about building real-world AI systems that blend **engineering precision and human context**.  
My past work spans enterprise platforms and research labs — from developing **multi-agent LLM chatbots** and **certificate automation systems** at AppViewX, to **supply-chain forecasting pipelines** at New Era Cap, and **personalized AAC conversational agents** at UB.  
Across every project, I focus on designing scalable, data-driven solutions that make technology more adaptive and empathetic.

🌱 Currently exploring **LangGraph, Azure AI Foundry, and Snowflake-powered ML Ops**, while experimenting with **LLM fine-tuning, RAG architectures,** and **agentic design** for collaborative AI systems.

🤝 Open for collaborations on **AI, ML, NLP, or data-driven projects** — especially those that connect human insight with intelligent automation.
