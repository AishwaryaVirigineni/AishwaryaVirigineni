👩‍💻 **About Me**  
I'm an engineer and researcher who loves turning data and models into practical, human-centered applications.  
My work spans **LLMs, Generative AI, and NLP**, where I focus on building scalable, intelligent systems that can reason, communicate, and adapt — from personalized AAC agents to forecasting automation for real-world supply chains.  

🤝 I thrive in collaborative environments — brainstorming new AI product ideas, co-building with diverse teams, and mentoring peers on architecture design or model deployment.  
I enjoy bridging **research and engineering**, ensuring every model can make measurable impact when deployed in production.
